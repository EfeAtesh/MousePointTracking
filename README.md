# MousePointTrackingApp
This android app does exists for usability testing. It will allow experimenters to track user's mouse direction in time. Data will be saved as CSV included every mouse action.
Only mouse or touches will be tracked unfortunately due to android's limitation.
Happy usability tests!



# How to use


- Open the application in windowed mode
- Press the **Start** button
- After you (or the user) have finished touching/clicking, press the **Stop** button
- Voilà! Your data is saved in `Documents/MPointTracking` as a `.csv` file

# History of This app
Well, why I decided to make this app, it was just because of I had a final project homework on lecture called BME417 - HUMAN COMPUTER INTERACTION. Professeur demands us to do a well recorded usability test and prepare a neat report for that test. I wanted to get highest grade possible ok. So I decided add more statistics to this usability test. Hence I made this app. I am going to use this app for usability test which is for MCA-Zero potentiostat, by the company I am working with called Sensitify,  and also this usability test will use Sensitify Go UI that I developed for their devices. 

Link to that app I developed: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sensitify.sensitifygo&pli=1

It basically allows electrochemists to interact with the device, and analyse their data from conducted experiments using that potentiostat. 

So that's it. This mouse tracker app will help usability tests!
